# cdn.ons.gov.uk vendored libraries

Vendored third party CDN libraries for ONS web services.

## Using vendored libraries

The `vendor` directory in this repository is published to the CDN
under an equivalent `vendor` directory.

E.g., to include jQuery 2.1.4 (from [vendor/jquery/2.1.4](vendor/jquery/2.1.4)), you would
link to the file using the following URL:

```txt
https://cdn.ons.gov.uk/vendor/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js
```
